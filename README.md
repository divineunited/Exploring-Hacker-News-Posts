# Exploring Hacker News Posts

*by Danny Vu*

This data exploration will be analyzing posts from the site Hacker News (HN) from the year 2016. The dataset I will be analyzing can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). I am particularly looking to discover how to get the most user activity from fellow HN users based on what time of day a post is published.

## Summary of Results:
After running a frequency table of the number of posts created at each hour and the overall number of comments that these posts recieved based on the hour, we discovered that posts created between 3-4 pm had way more activity than any other post. Before coming to our conclusion, we checked for outliers and found that a certain type of post had an incredible amount of activity - and that the majority of these posts were posted at that time. After removing those outliers, we got a tighter standard deviation and found that **posts created between 1-2 pm on the site Hacker News had the highest average activity from users.**
